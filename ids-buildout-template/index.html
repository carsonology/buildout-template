                        The phone rings, again. Justin Posthuma dashes across the narrow kitchen to pick up.

                    <p>
                        “Thanks for calling Trojan Horse, what can we get for you?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He calls out the order to the line cook manning the grill. Within five minutes, a stack of gyros
                        and pitas sit on the restaurant’s front counter, ready for pick up.
                    </p>
                    <div class="ad"></div>
                    <p>
                        Posthuma scrubs plates and pots and runs them through the commercial dishwasher. He negotiates a
                        work schedule with a new employee. He refills ice baths to chill tubs of chopped veggies that
                        don’t fit in the Trojan Horse’s fridge. He hurries back to the ringing phone.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At 1:30 p.m., Posthuma is six hours into his Wednesday shift as the restaurant manager at the
                        Trojan Horse. Business is slow, but his to-do list is infinite. It’s been that way for months,
                        as the restaurant grapples with the fallout from COVID-19. Not only have profits dropped since
                        the start of the pandemic, the Trojan Horse has also faced a severe staffing shortage.

                            Justin Posthuma is seen cooking Dec. 3, 2021, through the window of the Trojan Horse
                            restaurant. Posthuma works 12- to 13-hour shifts at the restaurant, helping out in whatever
                            role needs to be filled.

                    <p>
                        Last spring, a full kitchen staff dwindled to zero, leaving Posthuma and the owner to take over
                        the cooking. Bartenders and floor managers became a thing of the past. Seven days a week turned
                        to five and weekday closing time shifted from 11 p.m. to 8.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “When the world ended,” Posthuma said, “it flipped everything upside down.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before COVID-19 hit him, Steve wasn’t that worried about the virus. He knew it was important to
                        wash your hands and sanitize, that it was good to wear a mask and it would be smart to not go
                        out as much. But he did not think he was old enough to be seriously affected by the virus. He
                        thought his asthma and heart condition were in check.

                            universities kept its doors open through spiking cases and daily uncertainty</a></p>
                    <p>
                        Now, he is a strong advocate for wearing masks and reminds people that just because the virus
                        hasn’t directly affected them doesn’t mean it’s fake. He tells them that he knows — he went
                        through it himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I find myself getting sad for the people that get upset about having to wear a mask,” he said.
                        “It makes me want to scratch my head.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He said he’s even had some conversations with his family about masks because his older daughter
                        Allyson isn’t as enthusiastic about using them. Allyson said she is fully aware that the virus
                        is real and recognizes the long-lasting effects, but she doesn’t like the government controlling
                        her health or what she can and can’t do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Steve said he supports a mask mandate, he doesn’t believe the pandemic is over and that now we
                        should focus more on preventing COVID-19 spread than healing the economy.

                            Moore household. After being released from the hospital Steve wanted to go out to dinner
                            with his family, but was unable to because the restaurants were not open and he did not
                            realize how quarantine had affected the community during his time in the hospital and
                            rehabilitation centers.

                        However, when asked if he had any direct criticisms of President Donald Trump’s COVID-19
                        response, Steve said he feels that he doesn’t know as much about the virus as those in charge of
                        our country. He said since he hasn’t served in Trump’s position he can’t condemn Trump’s
                        actions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Subheadline introducing next section</h3>
                    <p>
                        Steve also said he doesn’t know exactly where the federal government could have crossed into
                        state politics. He said he did not know Trump could have established a nationwide mask mandate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Steve voted in person for President Donald Trump on October 31. He said he voted for Trump
                        because he saw him as the lesser of two evils. He said he was scared by how aggressively the
                        Democratic party had been attacking Trump and trying to remove a Republican president. So, he
                        voted against the Democrats.

                    <p>
                        He also said it’s hard for him to say the president or our state government should have put in
                        particular restrictions in the past because we are continuously learning about the virus. Steve
                        operates under the idea that even though our nation’s leaders know the most, we don’t know a lot
                        about the virus.

                        We Rate Covid Dashboards, a group of Yale University professors and medical students that
                        evaluates university COVID-19 dashboards, assessed IU’s about a week ago. At first, it got a C+.
                        Early this week, it was rescored to a B-.

                        Yale's health care management program, immediately after pulling up IU’s COVID-19 tracking
                        website on his computer. “I mean, come on, they’re a big state university, why would they have
                        such limited information? That’s disappointing.”

                        Forman, who founded We Rate Covid Dashboards with a colleague, said the site grades dashboards
                        based on nine categories, including if they are easy to read, updated daily, provide separate
                        student and faculty data, state how often people are tested and give a summary of how the campus
                        is handling the coronavirus.

                        IU earned six out of 13 possible points, increasing by one point when it was reevaluated due to
                        an error in We Rate Covid Dashboards original grade. While easy to read, the dashboard is not
                        updated daily, does not include city or county data, does not state how soon tests come back and
                        does not give a summary of the campus status.

                        The experience of eating at the Trojan Horse has changed very little since it opened at the
                        corner of Kirkwood and Walnut in 1978. There’s a new owner now, and the building’s brick facade
                        was restored a few years ago, but almost everything else has stayed the same for 44 years. The
                        spice blend used to make the gyro meat, the baklava recipe, the wooden booths, the giant wooden
                        front ship’s door with chainlinks for a handle.

                        Priest said she’s had customers who bring their kids and reminisce about coming to the Trojan
                        Horse with their parents when they were young. One couple visited on the 10,000th day of their
                        relationship because they had their second date there.

                        This reputation as a fixture in Bloomington’s restaurant scene has helped keep the place alive
                        through COVID-19 lockdown and an economic recession. In the past few months, as people venture
                        out to eat, more customers have frequented the Trojan Horse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the past few weeks, the restaurant has had several days with close to pre-COVID-19 profits.
                        In October, it hired half a dozen new line cooks. A couple servers, including Marquez, have
                        since quit, but Posthuma is happy that they’re moving on to new opportunities.
