                        Before COVID-19 hit him, Steve wasn’t that worried about the virus. He knew it was important to wash your hands and sanitize, that it was good to wear a mask and it would be smart to not go out as much. But he did not think he was old enough to be seriously affected by the virus. He thought his asthma and heart condition were in check.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, he is a strong advocate for wearing masks and reminds people that just because the virus hasn’t directly affected them doesn’t mean it’s fake. He tells them that he knows — he went through it himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I find myself getting sad for the people that get upset about having to wear a mask,” he said. “It makes me want to scratch my head.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="related"><span style="font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;"><b>Related:</b></span> <a href="http://specials.idsnews.com/iu-coronavirus-testing/" target="_blank" class="story-link">IU’s great big COVID-19 experiment: How one of the nation’s largest universities kept its doors open through spiking cases and daily uncertainty</a></p>
                    <p>
                        He said he’s even had some conversations with his family about masks because his older daughter Allyson isn’t as enthusiastic about using them. Allyson said she is fully aware that the virus is real and recognizes the long-lasting effects, but she doesn’t like the government controlling her health or what she can and can’t do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Steve said he supports a mask mandate, he doesn’t believe the pandemic is over and that now we should focus more on preventing COVID-19 spread than healing the economy.

After being released from the hospital Steve wanted to go out to dinner with his family, but was unable to because the restaurants were not open and he did not realize how quarantine had affected the community during his time in the hospital and rehabilitation centers.

                        However, when asked if he had any direct criticisms of President Donald Trump’s COVID-19 response, Steve said he feels that he doesn’t know as much about the virus as those in charge of our country. He said since he hasn’t served in Trump’s position he can’t condemn Trump’s actions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Steve also said he doesn’t know exactly where the federal government could have crossed into state politics. He said he did not know Trump could have established a nationwide mask mandate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Steve voted in person for President Donald Trump on October 31. He said he voted for Trump because he saw him as the lesser of two evils. He said he was scared by how aggressively the Democratic party had been attacking Trump and trying to remove a Republican president. So, he voted against the Democrats.

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        He also said it’s hard for him to say the president or our state government should have put in particular restrictions in the past because we are continuously learning about the virus. Steve operates under the idea that even though our nation’s leaders know the most, we don’t know a lot about the virus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I can’t ridicule the government like I know more than they do, because I don’t feel like any of us know a ton about this,” Steve said.

                        “That’s a horrible dashboard,” said Howard Forman, professor of public health and director of Yale's health care management program, immediately after pulling up IU’s COVID-19 tracking website on his computer. “I mean, come on, they’re a big state university, why would they have such limited information? That’s disappointing.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Forman, who founded We Rate Covid Dashboards with a colleague, said the site grades dashboards based on nine categories, including if they are easy to read, updated daily, provide separate student and faculty data, state how often people are tested and give a summary of how the campus is handling the coronavirus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        IU earned six out of 13 possible points, increasing by one point when it was reevaluated due to an error in We Rate Covid Dashboards original grade. While easy to read, the dashboard is not updated daily, does not include city or county data, does not state how soon tests come back and does not give a summary of the campus status. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        University of Michigan, Ohio State University, Northwestern University and Purdue University also saw their dashboard grade increase in the recent reevaluation. Overall, five of the 14 schools in the Big Ten got a B+  — eight points — or higher, and IU had the worst score of all schools in the conference, scoring the same as Rutgers University and Northwestern University.
