<h2>:computer: Buildout template</h2>
This is the template for the IDS buildouts. Please let the digi desk know if you notice any issues/missing styles that should be added.

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Look over template in browser to see available stock elements</li>
  <li>Replace dummy content with your own content in the index.html file</li>
  <li>Change all styles in the styles.css file</li>
  <li>You shouldn't have to change the ids.css styles — if you see any problems here, contact digi</li>
</ul>
<em>More specific instructions listed in styles.css file and index.html file.</em>

<h2>:snake: P tag generator</h2>
This is a Python script meant to speed up the buildout process. It automatically wraps paragraphs in <p> tags so you don't have to.
 <h3>Instructions:</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Download .py file</li>
  <li>Make sure you have Python on your computer and open up an interpreter (ex. IDLE, Atom, V S Code, etc.)</li>
  <li>Paste in all the paragraphs you want to wrap in p tags. Type 'end' at the end of the text and run.
  <li>Text will be output in Py console, and will also output to a text file in the same directory as your .py file.</li>
  <li>Copy and paste into your index.html file, and voila!</li>
 </ul>
